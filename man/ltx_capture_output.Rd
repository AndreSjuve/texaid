\title{Capture and format output as LaTeX-compatible text}
\usage{
ltx_capture_output(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object or expression whose output you wish to capture.
This can be a single object or multiple lines of text.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing the captured output, formatted with line breaks
if necessary. The result is returned invisibly, so it can be used without
printing the output directly.
}
\description{
The \code{ltx_capture_output} function captures the output of an object or
expression and formats it for LaTeX compatibility. This function can be used
to collect output that may be written over multiple lines and format it as a
character vector with appropriate line breaks for LaTeX output.
}
\details{
If \code{x} contains multiple elements (e.g., a vector or list), the function will
concatenate the elements using line breaks (\verb{\\n}) to ensure proper formatting
when the content is rendered as LaTeX. For single-element input, the output
will simply be captured and returned invisibly.

The function relies on \code{utils::capture.output()} to handle capturing the
output of expressions and converting them into a character vector. The use of
\code{cat()} ensures that multi-line elements are appropriately formatted.
