\title{Adjust LaTeX Table Placement}
\usage{
ltx_placement(
  x,
  tbl_placement = NULL,
  print_tbl = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  replace_idx = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector containing LaTeX code that includes
\verb{\\begin\{table\}} environments.}

\item{tbl_placement}{A string specifying the desired table placement
(e.g., \code{!htbp}). If NULL, defaults to \code{!htbp}.}

\item{print_tbl}{A logical indicating whether to print the modified LaTeX
table to the console. Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{A logical indicating whether to provide feedback during
execution. Default is TRUE.}

\item{replace_idx}{An integer specifying which occurrence of the
\verb{\\begin\{table\}} environment to replace. If NULL, all
occurrences will be replaced. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
The modified LaTeX code as a character vector, invisibly.
}
\description{
This function modifies the placement specifier of LaTeX tables within a
provided text. It allows for verbose feedback during execution and the option
to selectively replace specific table environments.

# Example LaTeX code with table environments

# Replace all table placements with '!htbp'

# Replace only the first table placement with 'H'
