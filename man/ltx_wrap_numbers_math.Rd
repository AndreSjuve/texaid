\title{Wrap Numbers in LaTeX Table in Math Mode}
\usage{
ltx_wrap_numbers_math(latex_table, print_tbl = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{latex_table}{A character vector or list containing the LaTeX table input.}

\item{print_tbl}{A logical value indicating whether to print the table to the console after modification. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A modified LaTeX table where all numbers are wrapped in math mode. The result is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
This function takes a LaTeX table as input and wraps all numbers, both
positive and negative, in LaTeX math mode (\verb{$number$}). The function ensures
that numbers are not already wrapped in math mode by checking for existing dollar signs.
}
\details{
The function supports both integers and decimal numbers, optionally
including commas as thousand separators. Additionally, it can handle scientific notation
(e.g., \code{1.23e4}) and superscripts (e.g., \code{10^{2}}).

The function uses a regular expression to identify and wrap numbers in LaTeX math mode. It:
\enumerate{
\item Ensures that numbers are not already wrapped in dollar signs.
\item Supports numbers with commas as thousand separators, decimal points, and scientific notation.
\item Optionally wraps numbers followed by LaTeX superscripts in math mode as well.
}

Explanation of Regular Expression:

\verb{(?<!\\\\$)-?\\\\b(\\\\d\{1,3\}(,\\\\d\{3\})*(\\\\.\\\\d+)?(e-?\\\\d+)?)(\\\\^\\\\\{[^\\\\\}]+\\\\\}\\\\S*)?(\\\\S*\\\\b)?(?![^$]*\\\\$)}
\enumerate{
\item \verb{(?<!\\\\$)}
\itemize{
\item A negative lookbehind that ensures no dollar sign (\code{$}) precedes the current position.
\item This prevents matching numbers already enclosed in LaTeX math mode.
}
\item \verb{-?}
\itemize{
\item Matches an optional negative sign, allowing the pattern to capture negative numbers.
}
\item \verb{\\\\b}
\itemize{
\item A word boundary to ensure the number is a standalone entity.
}
\item \verb{(\\\\d\{1,3\}(,\\\\d\{3\})*)}
\itemize{
\item Matches numbers, potentially separated by commas as thousand separators.
}
\item \verb{(\\\\.\\\\d+)?}
\itemize{
\item Optionally matches decimal numbers.
}
\item \verb{(e-?\\\\d+)?}
\itemize{
\item Optionally matches numbers in scientific notation (e.g., \code{1.23e4}).
}
\item \verb{(\\\\^\\\\\{[^\\\\\}]+\\\\\}\\\\S*)?}
\itemize{
\item Optionally matches LaTeX superscripts.
}
\item \verb{(?![^$]*\\\\$)}
\itemize{
\item A negative lookahead that ensures no dollar sign (\code{$}) follows the matched number.
}
}

\dontrun{
# Example LaTeX input with numbers
latex_input <- c("Value: 1234", "Temperature: 98.6", "Negative: -567.89")

# Wrap all numbers in math mode
result <- ltx_wrap_numbers_math(latex_input)

# Output: "Value: $1234$", "Temperature: $98.6$", "Negative: $-567.89$"
