\title{Save a ggplot Figure as a TikZ File}
\usage{
save_tikz(fig = NULL, path = NULL, sanitize = TRUE, width = 6.4, height = 3.54)
}
\arguments{
\item{fig}{A ggplot object. This is the figure to be saved as a TikZ file.}

\item{path}{A character string specifying the file path where the TikZ file will be saved.
If no extension is provided, \code{.tex} will be appended.
If the directory does not exist, an error will be raised.}

\item{sanitize}{Logical, whether to sanitize special characters in the LaTeX output.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{width}{Numeric, specifying the width of the figure in inches. Defaults to \code{6.4}.}

\item{height}{Numeric, specifying the height of the figure in inches. Defaults to \code{3.54}.}
}
\value{
The path to the saved TikZ file is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
This function saves a ggplot figure as a TikZ file for inclusion in LaTeX documents.
It checks for a valid ggplot object, ensures the file path is specified, and
appends the \code{.tex} extension if not provided. The function also allows sanitization
of special characters in the output file.
}
\details{
This function uses the \code{tikzDevice} package to generate TikZ code from a ggplot object.
It ensures that the file path provided is valid and appends the \code{.tex} extension if missing.
If the specified directory does not exist, the function will abort with an error message.
Additionally, the function provides useful information to the user, such as warnings
when no extension is provided and confirmation once the file is saved successfully.
}
\note{
The \code{tikzDevice} package must be installed to use this function.
